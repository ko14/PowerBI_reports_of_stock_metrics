# PowerBI_reports_of_stock_metrics

At the moment this only has one BI Power template, which gets its data from the raw csv file in this repo.  It shows the price change volatility for stocks with at least 1B market cap, 500k avg trading volume, and with prices for all 20 past trading days.  Price data is captured in separate process that is not shared here.
